Hate to have to redistribute the source of custom crafting, but the source is not publicly available. The only way I can add compatibility is to have the jar in a /libs/ folder.

To be able to provide support for CustomCrafting recipes I need to do either of these two things:
- Have a jar of CustomCrafting (or an API jar) in my /libs/ folder.
- Find a CustomCrafting github repository that I can use as a dependency thourgh jitpack.io
